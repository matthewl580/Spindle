<h1><b>Spindle</b></h1> <p style="font-size:14px">  <b> Programming language that enables you to practice AP CSP Exam code as real, live code.  </b> 
</b></b> <br> ‚≠ê Star us, it motivates us a lot!</div> <br>
<!-- insert naviation guide and gif on using spindle once the website is created <-->
<h1>üí° Core Principales</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Quality</b>: We want Spindle code look and function as close as possible to how it will on exam day</li>
<li><b>Simplicity</b>: We want to make learning computer principles as simple as possible for the average student</li>
<li><b>Affordabilty</b>: Not everyone has money to buy expensive study materials, as such Spindle will stay free - forever</li>
  <li><b>Transparency</b>: We are commited to keeping Spindle open to everyone who wishes to use it. Spindle will remain open-sourced.</li>
	<li><b>Accessibility</b>: Some people interested in computer science may not have access to laptops, or knowledgeable of a filesystem, so we want to make it as easy to use Spindle as possible</li>

</ol>

  


<h1>üíª Sample Code </h1>
<pre> <code>
# Displays "Hello Spindle!"
	DISPLAY("Hello Spindle!")
	</code> </pre>

 
<h1>üî® How To Use</h1> 
<b>Spindle can be used natively on desktop, or for ease of use, anywhere via it's website</b>
<h3>Quick Method (Running on website)</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to Spindle's website and click "code". Or just follow this link: <i>https://spdl.glitch.me/code</i></li>
	<li>Type your code in the "Code Input" box (if you don't know what to try, use the sample code above!)</li>
	<li>Click the run button!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Native Method (Running on desktop)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Download Spindle:</strong>
    <p>Head over to the releases section of the Spindle GitHub repository and download the latest version of the `Spindle.py` and `shell.py` files: <a href="https://github.com/matthewl580/Spindle/releases">You can find them here!</a></p>
    <p>You'll also want to download Python from its official website if you haven't already: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Which you can do here!</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create a Project Folder:</strong>
    <p>Create a new folder on your computer where you'll store your Spindle code. Name it whatever you like.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Extract Spindle Files:</strong>
    <p>Extract the downloaded files into your project folder. You should have two files in it so far: `Spindle.py` and `shell.py`.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Write Your Spindle Code:</strong>
    <p>Create a new text file within your project folder and save it with a filename ending in `.spdl` (e.g., `my_first_program.spdl`). This file will contain your Spindle code. Make sure you know the complete file name!</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run Your Code:</strong>
    <p>This can be done in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Method:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Run the `shell.py` file.</li>
          <li>Type `RUN("[FILENAME].spdl")`, replacing `[FILENAME]` with the actual filename of your Spindle code file (e.g., `my_first_program.spdl`).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
		 <li><strong>Advanced Method:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Open a terminal or command prompt.</li>
          <li>Navigate to your project folder using the `cd` command.</li>
          <li>Run the below command, replacing `[FILENAME]` with the actual filename of your Spindle code file (e.g., `my_first_program.spdl`):</li>
          <pre><code>python shell.py RUN("[FILENAME].spdl")</code></pre>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>üöÇ Want to Contribute?</h1>
Here's the thing about open-source software, <i>anyone</i> can contribute - and all meaningful contributions are valuable. You don't have to even touch any code to help us, if you find a bug, reporting it to us will help us fix it quicker. For those who do know a little code, you can help to make Spindle better for all by adding collegeboard features and pruning unnecessary ones. We'll even feature you, it's the least we could do!
